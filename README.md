AutoContent
================

ProcessWire module for automatic generation of content when a field is blank and also for generating test pages that can be "one-click" deleted.

Currently works for most default PW fieldtypes. Profields and selected third party fieldtypes coming shortly.

### Currently supported field types
* Text
* Textarea (RTE and plain) - content generated from http://loripsum.net/ API
* Datetime
* Integer
* Float
* Email
* URL
* Image - images generated by http://placehold.it using the field's min and max settings

### CONFIG SETTINGS

#### Module settings
You can change the locale which affects the content generated by the Faker library in text fields.

#### Field settings
Config settings for certain field types are available from the field's Input tab under the AutoContent Options section.

##### Textarea
There are multiple options for determing the content of the generated lorem ipsum text.
* number of paragraphs to generate.
* short, medium, long, verylong - The average length of a paragraph.
* decorate - Add bold, italic and marked text.
* link - Add links.
* ul - Add unordered lists.
* ol - Add numbered lists.
* dl - Add description lists.
* bq - Add blockquotes.
* code - Add code samples.
* headers - Add headers.

If the textarea inputfield type is not an RTE, then only the first two are available and output with be plain text.

##### Text
Generated content attempts to make use of the include Faker (https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) library.
The name of the field will attempted to be matched to available Faker properties automatically.
If there is no match, you can manually provide one under the Faker property config setting.
