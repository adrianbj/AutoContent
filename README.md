AutoContent
================

ProcessWire module for automatic generation of content when a field is blank

Currently works for most default PW fieldtypes. Profields and selected third party fieldtypes coming shortly.

###Currently supported field types
* Text
* Textarea (RTE and plain) - content generated from http://loripsum.net/ API
* Datetime
* Integer
* Float
* Email
* URL
* Image - images generated by http://placehold.it using the field's min and max settings

##CONFIG SETTINGS

So far the only field type that is configurable is Textarea - there are multiple options for determing the content of the generated lorem ipsum text.
* number of paragraphs to generate.
* short, medium, long, verylong - The average length of a paragraph.
* decorate - Add bold, italic and marked text.
* link - Add links.
* ul - Add unordered lists.
* ol - Add numbered lists.
* dl - Add description lists.
* bq - Add blockquotes.
* code - Add code samples.
* headers - Add headers.
* allcaps - Use ALL CAPS.

If the textarea inputfield type is not an RTE, then only the first two are available and output with be plain text.
